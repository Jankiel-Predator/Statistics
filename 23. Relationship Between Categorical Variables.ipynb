    "# Hypothesis Testing - Relationship Between Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The aim is to perform statistical testing of the relationship between categorical variables using the **Chi-squared Test for Independence** and **Fisher's Exact Test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Tests Characteristics & Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chi-squared Test for Independence\n",
    "The Chi-squared Test is used to understand if there is a relationship between two categorical variables. The test is useful in many fields including sociology, psychology, and medicine. The chi-square test is a powerful tool that can help researchers gain insight into their data and make informed decisions based on their findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fisher's Exact Test\n",
    "Fisher's Exact Test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant association\n",
    "between two categorical variables, especially in small sample sizes. It is based on the\n",
    "hypergeometric distribution and is particularly useful for analyzing (2 x 2) contingency\n",
    "tables.\n",
    "The hypergeometric distribution shows the probability of choosing ùëé objects from group A\n",
    "and ùëè objects from group B from the total number of ùëõ objects without returning, given that\n",
    "in the general population ùêæ objects belong to group A.\n",
    "Thus, the hypergeometric distribution is most suitable for modeling the situation described\n",
    "by Fisher's Exact Test, and so it is used to calculate the probability of obtaining the observed\n",
    "data given the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Tests\n",
    "Fisher's Exact Test and the Chi-squared (œá¬≤) Test are both used to analyze the association\n",
    "between categorical variables, but there are differences in their application and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "1. **Data Type:**\n",
    "    - Chi-squared Test: Used to analyze the association between two or more categorical variables when there is a contingency table with frequencies for categories.\n",
    "    - Fisher's Exact Test: Primarily applied to small sample sizes or 2x2 tables when expected\n",
    "cell counts may be low.\n",
    "2. **Distribution:**\n",
    "    - Chi-squared Test: Based on the Chi-squared distribution.\n",
    "    - Fisher's Exact Test: Based on the hypergeometric distribution.\n",
    "3. **Assumptions:**\n",
    "    - Chi-squared Test: Requires expected cell counts to be greater than 5 or 10 in each cell,\n",
    "depending on context.\n",
    "    - Fisher's Exact Test: Can be used without restrictions on expected cell counts.\n",
    "    - Fisher's Exact Test is a more precise alternative to the Chi-squared Test, especially when\n",
    "expected cell counts are low. When sample size is large, results of Fisher's Exact Test and\n",
    "Chi-squared Test will be approximately the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Formulation of Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snickers Preference by Gender\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** There is no relationship between gender and preference for Snickers.  \n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** There is a relationship between gender and preference for Snickers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Political Party Affiliation by Gender\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** There is no relationship between gender and political party affiliation.  \n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** There is a relationship between gender and political party affiliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Justfication for Test Selection\n",
    "\n",
    " For the Snickers preference data, both the Chi-squared test and Fisher's Exact test were employed. The Chi-squared test is appropriate for assessing associations between variables in moderate to large samples, while Fisher's Exact test is preferred for smaller sample sizes or when assumptions of the Chi-squared test are not met. Given the moderate sample size and to ensure robustness, both tests were applied. However, for the political party affiliation data, only the Chi-squared test was utilized due to the larger sample size and the suitability of the Chi-squared test for such data.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. Brief Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Snickers Preference by Gender:**\n",
    "  - The Chi-squared test and Fisher's Exact test both indicate a significant relationship between gender and preference for Snickers, with boys showing a higher preference for Snickers compared to girls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Political Party Affiliation by Gender:**\n",
    "  - The Chi-squared test indicates no significant relationship between gender and political party affiliation, suggesting that gender does not influence political party preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results, we conclude that gender and Snickers preference is related. This statistical test provide evidence against the null hypotheses, indicating that this relationship is indeed significant. However, the data provided emphasizes no evidence that gender affects political views of the person. In this case, the null hypothesis failed to be rejected using Chi-squared test."
