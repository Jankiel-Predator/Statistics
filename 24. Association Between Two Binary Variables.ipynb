    "# Hypothesis Testing - Association Between Two Binary Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The aim is to perform statistical testing of the relationship between categorical variables and measure the strength of association.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Cramer's V, Phi and Contingency Coefficients\n",
    "### Cramer's V\n",
    "Cramer's V is the most popular of the chi-square-based measures of nominal association\n",
    "because it is designed so that the attainable upper limit is always 1. It is based on the Chi-\n",
    "Square (χ²) statistic and can be applied to contingency tables of any size. The values of\n",
    "Cramér's V range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no association and 1 indicates a perfect\n",
    "association.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phi Coefficient\n",
    "The Phi coefficient (φ) is a measure of the strength of association between two binary\n",
    "variables. It is also called the Yule phi or Mean Square Contingency Coefficient and is used\n",
    "for contingency tables It is analogous to the Pearson correlation coefficient but is\n",
    "specifically designed for 2x2 contingency tables. The value of the Phi coefficient ranges\n",
    "from -1 to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contingency Coefficient\n",
    "The Contingency Coefficient is a measure of association between two categorical variables\n",
    "in a contingency table. It quantifies the strength of the relationship between the variables,\n",
    "taking into account the table's dimensions. The coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0\n",
    "indicates no association, and 1 indicates a perfect association. The contingency coefficient suffers from the disadvantage that it does not reach a maximum of 1.0, notably the highest it can reach in a 2×2 table is 0.707 . It can reach values closer to 1.0 in contingency tables\n",
    "with more categories; for example, it can reach a maximum of 0.870 in a 4 × 4 table. It\n",
    "should, therefore, not be used to compare associations in different tables if they have\n",
    "different numbers of categories\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Formulation of Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Snickers Preference by Gender\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no relationship between gender and preference for Snickers.  \n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a relationship between gender and preference for Snickers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Political Party Affiliation by Gender\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no relationship between gender and political party affiliation.  \n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a relationship between gender and political party affiliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Writing Experience by Discipline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no relationship between a student's discipline and their technical writing experience.  \n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a relationship between a student's discipline and their technical writing experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Justification for Test Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "For all datasets, the Chi-squared test is appropriate for assessing associations between categorical variables in contingency tables. Fisher's Exact Test will be used for the Snickers preference data due to its 2x2 nature. Measures of association (Cramér's V, Phi coefficient, and Contingency Coefficient) will be calculated to establish the degree of relationship if the variables are dependent.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Snickers Preference by Gender**:\n",
    "  - The Chi-squared test and Fisher's Exact Test both indicate a significant relationship between gender and preference for Snickers, with boys showing a higher preference for Snickers compared to girls.\n",
    "  - The Phi coefficient indicates a weak association between gender and Snickers preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Political Party Affiliation by Gender:**\n",
    "  - The Chi-squared test indicates no significant relationship between gender and political party affiliation, suggesting that gender does not influence political party preference.\n",
    "  - Both Cramér's V and the Contingency Coefficient suggest a very weak association.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technical Writing Experience by Discipline:**\n",
    "  - The Chi-squared test indicates a significant relationship between a student's discipline and their technical writing experience.\n",
    "  - Both Cramér's V and the Contingency Coefficient suggest a moderate association, indicating that a student's discipline moderately influences their level of technical writing experience."
