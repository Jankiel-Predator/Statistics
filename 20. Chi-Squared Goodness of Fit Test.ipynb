    "\n",
    "- The chi-square test results indicate that, regardless of the sample size and significance level, there is not enough evidence to suggest that the proportions observed in the sample are different from the proportions in the general population.\n",
    "- As the sample size increases, the chi-square test statistic tends to increase slightly, but the p-value remains consistently high, leading to a failure to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- Adjusting the significance level does not significantly affect the acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis, as the p-values are consistently higher than the chosen alpha values.\n",
    "- Overall, the analysis suggests that the proportions observed in the sample are likely to be representative of the proportions in the general population, as indicated by the failure to reject the null hypothesis across different sample sizes and significance levels."
